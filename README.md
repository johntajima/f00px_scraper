# F00pxScraper

Exports a list of photographers from the various 500px photo streams (popular, editors, fresh, etc.)

You specify which feature list, starting and end pages, # of results per page (max 100) and it will use the API to grab the photos for the feature list, and lookup photographer details for that list and save them to a CSV file.
